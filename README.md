# Pomodoro Timer - a React Project (module 9 - The first app)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A timer for studying. 25 minutes countdown, then a alarm will sound, and the timer will change to break timer for 5 minutes, and then it goes back. This is how it looks like:
